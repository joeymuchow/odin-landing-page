# odin-landing-page

This is a project in the Foundations course for The Odin Project, where we created a landing page from scratch based off an image.

I did run into an issue during this project that corrupted some files in my local git, so my commit history is not completely indicitve of how I was adding stuff. I think leaving my VM running while I was away for a bit might have caused this issue.
